        "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen offers conversable LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n",
        "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and `max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits feedback from the human user or returns auto-feedback based on the result of code execution (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`. `AssistantAgent` will debug the code and suggest new code if the result contains error. The two agents keep communicating to each other until the task is done.\n",

However, please note that this script assumes that you have the necessary permissions and keys to access the APIs used.   To run this script in Google Colab, you would need to upload the .docx file to your Colab environment. You can do this by clicking on the folder icon in the left sidebar, then click on the upload button.
