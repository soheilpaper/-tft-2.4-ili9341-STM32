        "This pattern contrasts sharply with **models of complete love,** such as the **seven types of love defined by the ancient Greeks** or **Sternberg’s triangular theory of love (intimacy, passion, commitment).** To help individuals break free from such patterns, it is critical to first understand **why dysfunctional love arises** and to provide a clear, alternative path toward complete and reciprocal love.\n",

We also consider a scenario where the person might exit the asexual state in an emotional relationship. We will present a table to cover these various states.\n",

        "1. **Asexuality due to focusing on the quality of a non-sexual relationship**\n",
        "   - In this state, the person might not desire sexual relationships because they value the quality of non-sexual relationships more.\n",
        "   - This asexuality might be a conscious choice rather than a limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exiting the asexual state in an emotional relationship**\n",
        "   - If a strong and meaningful emotional relationship is formed, the person might exit the asexual state.\n",
        "   - This means that in the presence of an emotional relationship, sexual inclinations might emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scenario of inability to create an effective emotional relationship**\n",
        "   - In some cases, a person might not be able to create an effective emotional relationship.\n",
        "   - This could be due to unrealistic expectations or inability to establish deep communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Considering gender change**\n",
        "   - In some cases, gender change might be considered as an option, but it is a complex and personal decision.\n",
        "   - This decision should be made based on a deep understanding of oneself and expectations.\n",

We also explored the scenario of exiting the asexual state in an emotional relationship and the inability to create an effective relationship. Finally, considering gender change as a personal and complex option was discussed. These topics indicate that each relationship is unique and requires understanding and acceptance.\n",

Evidence: The World Bank reports a “lost decade” (2011-2020), with GDP growth 12-19% below a no-sanctions scenario. Iran’s 2023 GDP was ~$401.5 billion, per MacroTrends. A 13.6% drop in 2018-2019 equates to ~$54 billion/year, suggesting $648 billion over 12 years. The $1.2 trillion figure, per Wikipedia, implies $100 billion annually, possibly including lost oil revenue. FDI fell from $4.2 billion in 2011 to $1.3 billion in 2021.

Evidence: The World Bank estimates air pollution costs at $13-30 billion/year, with water scarcity adding billions. Over 20 years, pollution could hit $500 billion, worsened by 43% forest loss since 1900 and droughts.

        "This report explores how Iranian women involved in the “Women, Life, Freedom” movement, particularly those based in Turkey due to Iran’s restrictive policies, can leverage the Iranian diaspora’s resources to obtain Spain’s digital nomad visa. It details the visa’s requirements, estimates the availability of diaspora-owned companies to provide remote work, and identifies accessible freelance jobs to meet visa criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spain’s digital nomad visa, introduced to attract remote workers, is accessible to non-EU/EEA citizens, including Iranians. The visa allows residence in Spain while working for non-Spanish employers or clients, with up to 20% of income permissible from Spanish sources for freelancers. The income threshold is tied to Spain’s minimum wage (SMI), set at approximately €1,381.33/month for 2025 (based on an annual SMI of €16,576). The main applicant must earn at least 200% of this, or €2,763/month. For families, additional income is required: 75% of SMI (€1,036) for the first dependent (e.g., spouse) and 25% (€345) for each additional dependent (e.g., child). For example, a family of three needs €4,144/month. Other requirements include a valid passport, health insurance covering Spain with a minimum of €30,000/year, a criminal record certificate from countries resided in over the past five years, and at least three months of stable work with current employers or clients to ensure job legitimacy. Freelancers need contracts with multiple clients, ideally non-Spanish, to avoid scrutiny over employment authenticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Iranian diaspora, estimated at 4–5 million people, is a vital resource for women activists seeking remote work to qualify for the visa. Concentrated in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, many diaspora members are professionals or business owners in fields like technology, engineering, and marketing. Precise data on diaspora-owned companies is scarce, but general immigrant entrepreneurship rates provide a basis for estimation. In the US, approximately 10–12% of immigrants are entrepreneurs, with 21.5% of self-employed workers being immigrants. Assuming a conservative 10% entrepreneurship rate among the 4 million diaspora members, around 400,000 businesses could exist. However, only a subset—perhaps 10% (40,000)—operates in industries like tech, consulting, or digital services that typically hire remote workers. These businesses, particularly in North America and Europe, are well-positioned to offer freelance or remote roles. For example, Iranian-American leaders head companies like Uber and eBay, suggesting a strong presence in tech. Smaller diaspora firms in content creation, IT, or marketing could also provide opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connecting activists in Turkey with diaspora employers is challenging due to limited networks and Iran’s restrictive environment, where government policies discriminate against women, as noted in UN reports. Many women may lack access to professional platforms or diaspora contacts. Additionally, some diaspora members may be hesitant to engage due to political sensitivities or lack of awareness about the activists’ needs. Several platforms facilitate remote work for Iranians, though not all are diaspora-specific. IranTalent, a leading job site, connects professionals with international and Iranian firms, with over 2 million users. GitHub repositories, like “awesome-iran-remote,” identify 327 remote-friendly companies, though many are Iran-based. Global platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Deel enable freelancers to find international clients, including diaspora businesses. Diaspora-led initiatives, such as Iranian Alliances Across Borders (IAAB), focus on community engagement but could expand to job-matching programs. Advocacy groups like the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) connect diaspora and local activists, potentially facilitating employment networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of digital nomad visas obtainable depends on individual qualifications and job offers, with no fixed cap on visas issued. Each activist must secure remote work meeting the €2,763/month threshold. Given the diaspora’s size and entrepreneurial activity, thousands of remote job opportunities could theoretically be available annually. For example, if 1% of the estimated 40,000 relevant diaspora businesses hire one freelancer each, 400 activists could secure qualifying jobs. However, practical constraints—such as language barriers, skill mismatches, or limited outreach—may reduce this number. A realistic estimate might be hundreds of visas annually, assuming targeted efforts by diaspora networks and advocacy groups to match activists with employers. Platforms like IranTalent and Upwork can scale this further by connecting activists to global clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Freelance roles are ideal for meeting the visa’s income and employment requirements, as they allow flexibility and access to international clients. Suitable roles include social media management, content creation, and programming. Social media management involves managing accounts like Instagram or LinkedIn, creating posts, and engaging audiences, earning $500–$2,000/month on platforms like Upwork. Content creation, such as writing blogs or using AI tools like Jasper, pays $20–$100/hour. Programming for web or app development, with languages like Python or JavaScript, earns $30–$150/hour. Graphic design, using tools like Canva or Adobe, pays $25–$75/hour. Translation services, particularly Persian to English, range from $0.05–$0.20/word. Virtual assistance, including administrative support, pays $10–$30/hour. Online tutoring, such as Persian language lessons via Preply, earns $15–$50/hour. Digital marketing, managing SEO or ads, pays $20–$80/hour. These roles are accessible to women with varying skill levels, requiring only a computer and internet access, available in Turkey. By securing multiple clients, activists can meet the €2,763/month threshold within 4–5 months of consistent work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iran’s government imposes severe restrictions on women’s rights, described as “gender apartheid” by advocacy groups. This makes activism within Iran dangerous, pushing many women to operate from Turkey, where they face fewer restrictions but need economic stability. The “Women, Life, Freedom” movement, sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death, has galvanized diaspora support, with grassroots organizations drafting a “Bill of Women’s Rights.” Remote work via the diaspora offers a pathway to financial independence and visa eligibility, enabling activists to continue their advocacy from Spain.\n",
        "\n",
        "To succeed, activists should build skills in high-demand freelance areas through online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy), join diaspora networks via LinkedIn or organizations like IAAB, create profiles on Upwork, Fiverr, and IranTalent, consult immigration lawyers for visa applications, and partner with groups like CHRI to advocate for job-matching programs. The Iranian diaspora’s entrepreneurial and professional resources offer a promising pathway for women activists in Turkey to obtain Spain’s digital nomad visa. While challenges like network access and skill gaps exist, platforms and diaspora initiatives can bridge these, potentially enabling hundreds of activists to relocate to Spain annually.\n",
