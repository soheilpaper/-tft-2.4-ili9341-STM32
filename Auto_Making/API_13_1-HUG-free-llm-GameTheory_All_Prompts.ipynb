        "In this post, we aim to explore various states in a relationship, especially when the person in question might be asexual, but the primary reason for this asexuality is focusing on the quality of a non-sexual relationship. We also consider a scenario where the person might exit the asexual state in an emotional relationship. We will present a table to cover these various states.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Various States in a Relationship**\n",
        "1. **Asexuality due to focusing on the quality of a non-sexual relationship**\n",
        "   - In this state, the person might not desire sexual relationships because they value the quality of non-sexual relationships more.\n",
        "   - This asexuality might be a conscious choice rather than a limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exiting the asexual state in an emotional relationship**\n",
        "   - If a strong and meaningful emotional relationship is formed, the person might exit the asexual state.\n",
        "   - This means that in the presence of an emotional relationship, sexual inclinations might emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scenario of inability to create an effective emotional relationship**\n",
        "   - In some cases, a person might not be able to create an effective emotional relationship.\n",
        "   - This could be due to unrealistic expectations or inability to establish deep communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Considering gender change**\n",
        "   - In some cases, gender change might be considered as an option, but it is a complex and personal decision.\n",
        "   - This decision should be made based on a deep understanding of oneself and expectations.\n",

We also explored the scenario of exiting the asexual state in an emotional relationship and the inability to create an effective relationship. Finally, considering gender change as a personal and complex option was discussed. These topics indicate that each relationship is unique and requires understanding and acceptance.\n",

        "\n",

These opportunities align with the project's emphasis on community involvement, social responsibility, habitat protection, and creating a sustainable conservation model. Below is a curated list of platforms and funding programs that could support this initiative, along with explanations of their relevance.\",\n",
        "    \"1. Global Environment Facility (GEF): GEF has historically funded biodiversity projects, including efforts targeting endangered species like the Asiatic cheetah in Iran. The Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) is an example of a GEF-supported initiative. It focuses on biodiversity conservation, habitat protection, and sustainable development. Proposals can be submitted through GEF’s implementing agencies (e.g., UNDP, UNEP) with collaboration from national governments or NGOs like Iran’s Department of Environment. The requested 1.97 billion IRR (~$47,000 USD at current informal rates) falls within the scope of GEF Small Grants Programme (up to $50,000). The next step is to contact the GEF focal point in Iran or partner with UNDP Iran for application guidance.\",\n",
        "    \"2. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - Iran: UNDP Iran is actively involved in Phase II of the CACP, emphasizing sustainability in protected areas and community engagement—key pillars of your project. It focuses on community-based conservation, capacity building, and policy improvement. Proposals can be submitted via UNDP’s country office in Iran, often in partnership with local stakeholders like the Iranian Department of Environment or NGOs such as the Iranian Cheetah Society. UNDP grants vary but can accommodate the proposed budget with co-financing from stakeholders like Parsian Petragan Co. The next step is to reach out to UNDP Iran (e.g., through their website or local office) to align your proposal with CACP Phase II objectives.\",\n",
        "    \"3. Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF): CEPF supports biodiversity hotspots, including the Irano-Anatolian region where the Asiatic cheetah resides. It emphasizes civil society involvement and local community participation. Its focus includes endangered species, habitat restoration, and community-driven conservation. Check CEPF’s open calls for the Eastern Mediterranean or Irano-Anatolian hotspots (via cepf.net). Grants typically range from $20,000 to $100,000, aligning with the project’s budget. The next step is to review current calls and prepare a letter of inquiry highlighting collaboration with local NGOs and communities.\",\n",
        "    \"4. Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund: This fund specifically targets endangered species conservation, including the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah. It supports fieldwork, equipment purchases, and community education—matching your project’s needs (e.g., vehicles, guards, awareness programs). It focuses on species-specific conservation with a global scope. Submit an online application at mbzspeciesconservation.org (max grant: $25,000, though multiple applications can be considered). You may need to scale down or seek co-funding, as $25,000 is below your total request. The next step is to apply for vehicle and equipment costs, emphasizing the cheetah’s critical status.\",\n",
        "    \"5. Rufford Foundation Small Grants: Rufford funds practical conservation projects, particularly in developing countries, with a focus on local involvement and endangered species—ideal for your community-based approach. It focuses on wildlife conservation, habitat protection, and education. Submit an application at rufford.org (grants up to £15,000/~$19,000 USD). Multiple funding levels are available for scaling up. Combine with other funds to meet the 1.97 billion IRR requirement. The next step is to highlight the role of local communities and the replicability of your model in the application.\",\n",
        "    \"6. Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN): WCN partners with grassroots conservationists and supports species-specific projects, often through fundraising campaigns and grants. It focuses on endangered species and innovative conservation models. Connect with WCN partners like the Iranian Cheetah Society or submit a proposal via wildlifeconservationnetwork.org. Funding varies; co-financing with Parsian Petragan Co. could bridge gaps. The next step is to pitch your sustainable model and community engagement strategy to WCN.\",\n",
        "    \"7. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) - Save Our Species (SOS): SOS funds projects protecting critically endangered species like the Asiatic cheetah, with an emphasis on habitat security and policy advocacy. It focuses on species survival, threat reduction, and stakeholder collaboration. Check for open calls at iucn.org/sos and submit a proposal (grants typically $25,000-$100,000). This is suitable for your needs, especially with co-financing from listed stakeholders. The next step is to align your proposal with IUCN Red List priorities for the Asiatic cheetah.\",\n",
        "    \"Additional Recommendations: Collaborate with local stakeholders to strengthen your proposal by formalizing partnerships with the Iranian Department of Environment, Iranian Cheetah Society, and local communities, as outlined in your document. These collaborations can enhance eligibility for international funding. Search X and web for calls using keywords like 'Asiatic cheetah conservation grants 2025' or 'Iran biodiversity funding' on platforms like X or conservation grant portals (e.g., fundsforngos.org) for real-time opportunities. Tailor your budget, as some grants have caps below your 1.97 billion IRR request. Prioritize key items (e.g., vehicles, guards) and seek co-financing from Parsian Petragan Co. or other listed contributors.\",\n",

Iran’s instability, orchestrated by an oligarchic and religiously fascist regime, has cost ~$2.2 trillion: $1.2 trillion in economic losses from sanctions and elite theft, $500 billion in environmental damage from corrupt neglect, and $500 billion in speculative unrest costs tied to oppression. These estimates, drawn from sources like the World Bank and IMF, need scrutiny. The $3.5 billion from fuel smuggling, stolen by the regime’s dark forces, could fund hospitals daily but enriches zombies who perpetuate poverty.

Claim: Sanctions and elite theft have cost $1.2 trillion, with foreign direct investment (FDI) down 80% from 2011-2021. Evidence: The World Bank reports a “lost decade” (2011-2020), with GDP growth 12-19% below a no-sanctions scenario. Iran’s 2023 GDP was ~$401.5 billion, per MacroTrends. A 13.6% drop in 2018-2019 equates to ~$54 billion/year, suggesting $648 billion over 12 years. The $1.2 trillion figure, per Wikipedia, implies $100 billion annually, possibly including lost oil revenue. FDI fell from $4.2 billion in 2011 to $1.3 billion in 2021. A ScienceDirect study confirms a 17% GDP drop (2011-2014). The oligarchy’s smuggling, like the $3.5 billion, fuels their lavish lives, not public welfare.\",\n",

Claim: Corrupt mismanagement and sanctions have caused $500 billion in environmental damage. Evidence: The World Bank estimates air pollution costs at $13-30 billion/year, with water scarcity adding billions. Over 20 years, pollution could hit $500 billion, worsened by 43% forest loss since 1900 and droughts.

Claim: Unrest and potential conflicts, funded by smuggling, could cost $1.8 trillion in three months, with $500 billion as a baseline. Evidence: No major war exists; SIPRI reports 2023 military spending at $10.3 billion. A 2012 CNN report estimates a U.S.-Iran war at $2-3 trillion globally, but $1.8 trillion for Iran lacks support. Protests in 2022 cost ~$38 million/day, per Future UAE. Smuggling funds arm militias and police, per Al Jazeera.\",\n",

For families, additional income is required: 75% of SMI (€1,036) for the first dependent (e.g., spouse) and 25% (€345) for each additional dependent (e.g., child). For example, a family of three needs €4,144/month. Other requirements include a valid passport, health insurance covering Spain with a minimum of €30,000/year, a criminal record certificate from countries resided in over the past five years, and at least three months of stable work with current employers or clients to ensure job legitimacy. Freelancers need contracts with multiple clients, ideally non-Spanish, to avoid scrutiny over employment authenticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Iranian diaspora, estimated at 4–5 million people, is a vital resource for women activists seeking remote work to qualify for the visa. Concentrated in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, many diaspora members are professionals or business owners in fields like technology, engineering, and marketing. Precise data on diaspora-owned companies is scarce, but general immigrant entrepreneurship rates provide a basis for estimation. In the US, approximately 10–12% of immigrants are entrepreneurs, with 21.5% of self-employed workers being immigrants. Assuming a conservative 10% entrepreneurship rate among the 4 million diaspora members, around 400,000 businesses could exist. However, only a subset—perhaps 10% (40,000)—operates in industries like tech, consulting, or digital services that typically hire remote workers. These businesses, particularly in North America and Europe, are well-positioned to offer freelance or remote roles. For example, Iranian-American leaders head companies like Uber and eBay, suggesting a strong presence in tech. Smaller diaspora firms in content creation, IT, or marketing could also provide opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connecting activists in Turkey with diaspora employers is challenging due to limited networks and Iran’s restrictive environment, where government policies discriminate against women, as noted in UN reports. Many women may lack access to professional platforms or diaspora contacts. Additionally, some diaspora members may be hesitant to engage due to political sensitivities or lack of awareness about the activists’ needs. Several platforms facilitate remote work for Iranians, though not all are diaspora-specific. IranTalent, a leading job site, connects professionals with international and Iranian firms, with over 2 million users. GitHub repositories, like “awesome-iran-remote,” identify 327 remote-friendly companies, though many are Iran-based. Global platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Deel enable freelancers to find international clients, including diaspora businesses. Diaspora-led initiatives, such as Iranian Alliances Across Borders (IAAB), focus on community engagement but could expand to job-matching programs. Advocacy groups like the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) connect diaspora and local activists, potentially facilitating employment networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of digital nomad visas obtainable depends on individual qualifications and job offers, with no fixed cap on visas issued. Each activist must secure remote work meeting the €2,763/month threshold. Given the diaspora’s size and entrepreneurial activity, thousands of remote job opportunities could theoretically be available annually. For example, if 1% of the estimated 40,000 relevant diaspora businesses hire one freelancer each, 400 activists could secure qualifying jobs. However, practical constraints—such as language barriers, skill mismatches, or limited outreach—may reduce this number. A realistic estimate might be hundreds of visas annually, assuming targeted efforts by diaspora networks and advocacy groups to match activists with employers. Platforms like IranTalent and Upwork can scale this further by connecting activists to global clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Freelance roles are ideal for meeting the visa’s income and employment requirements, as they allow flexibility and access to international clients. Suitable roles include social media management, content creation, and programming. Social media management involves managing accounts like Instagram or LinkedIn, creating posts, and engaging audiences, earning $500–$2,000/month on platforms like Upwork. Content creation, such as writing blogs or using AI tools like Jasper, pays $20–$100/hour. Programming for web or app development, with languages like Python or JavaScript, earns $30–$150/hour. Graphic design, using tools like Canva or Adobe, pays $25–$75/hour. Translation services, particularly Persian to English, range from $0.05–$0.20/word. Virtual assistance, including administrative support, pays $10–$30/hour. Online tutoring, such as Persian language lessons via Preply, earns $15–$50/hour. Digital marketing, managing SEO or ads, pays $20–$80/hour. These roles are accessible to women with varying skill levels, requiring only a computer and internet access, available in Turkey. By securing multiple clients, activists can meet the €2,763/month threshold within 4–5 months of consistent work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iran’s government imposes severe restrictions on women’s rights, described as “gender apartheid” by advocacy groups. This makes activism within Iran dangerous, pushing many women to operate from Turkey, where they face fewer restrictions but need economic stability. The “Women, Life, Freedom” movement, sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death, has galvanized diaspora support, with grassroots organizations drafting a “Bill of Women’s Rights.” Remote work via the diaspora offers a pathway to financial independence and visa eligibility, enabling activists to continue their advocacy from Spain.\n",
        "\n",
        "To succeed, activists should build skills in high-demand freelance areas through online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy), join diaspora networks via LinkedIn or organizations like IAAB, create profiles on Upwork, Fiverr, and IranTalent, consult immigration lawyers for visa applications, and partner with groups like CHRI to advocate for job-matching programs. The Iranian diaspora’s entrepreneurial and professional resources offer a promising pathway for women activists in Turkey to obtain Spain’s digital nomad visa. While challenges like network access and skill gaps exist, platforms and diaspora initiatives can bridge these, potentially enabling hundreds of activists to relocate to Spain annually.\n",

        "Brain tumor diagnosis is hindered by significant challenges, including misdiagnosis rates of up to 40%, diagnostic delays of days to weeks, and a 55% radiologist shortage in some European regions, leading to late-stage diagnoses and reduced survival rates. Lumind AI, an AI-powered diagnostic assistant, addresses these issues by leveraging deep learning algorithms trained on 260,000 brain CT scans from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Utilizing convolutional neural networks, it achieves a reported 95% accuracy in tumor detection, processing scans in seconds, and generates outputs like tumor segmentation, abnormality scores, and heatmaps. This paper examines Lumind AI’s system architecture, performance metrics, and potential to transform neuro-oncology by reducing errors, alleviating radiologist workload, and improving patient outcomes. We focus on its scalability in European healthcare, particularly the Netherlands, where innovation ecosystems like the Netherlands AI Coalition support adoption. Market drivers, such as a 4.26% annual increase in imaging volumes and rising chronic disease prevalence, favor implementation, while high procurement costs and GDPR-related privacy concerns pose barriers. The roadmap includes clinical validation, PACS integration, and regional expansion. Lumind AI advances precision medicine, but limitations, such as dataset biases and ethical concerns, require scrutiny. This study highlights AI’s transformative potential in brain tumor diagnostics, advocating for rigorous testing to ensure reliability.\n",

        "In many developing innovation ecosystems, there is a noticeable gap between academia and industry—particularly in research and development (R&D). Companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in technology exhibitions, frequently present sophisticated products and concepts but lack access to affordable, expert-level research support. Meanwhile, universities produce thousands of highly capable master's students, but those researchers remain invisible to industry due to the absence of effective matchmaking systems.\n",

        "FindExpert.ir aims to bridge this gap by offering a smart, AI-based matchmaking platform that automatically scrapes public academic profiles—such as those on Google Scholar, ORCID, and university websites—and constructs structured databases of individual researchers’ skills, topics, and published work. At the same time, the platform collects structured data on R&D requests from exhibition-participating companies or direct project briefs.\n",

        "Through natural language processing and intelligent clustering algorithms, the platform analyzes similarities between company needs and academic capabilities and then generates curated catalogues of potential academic collaborators.

        "    \"Memeplexes are collections of memes that cooperate to enhance their collective survival, much like gene complexes in biology. \"\n",
        "    \"Examples include religions, ideologies, and language systems.\\n\\n\"\n",
        "    \"3. 'Allah' as a Memeplex: Life, Spread, and Defense\\n\"\n",
        "    \"The concept of 'Allah' operates as a memeplex, living a conceptual life through its hosts—humans. \"\n",
        "    \"It spreads via language, rituals, and social norms, embedding itself in daily conversations, hopes, and fears. \"\n",
        "    \"As long as people invoke 'Allah' in their aspirations or anxieties, the memeplex persists and even strengthens, much like a virus adapting to its host.\\n\\n\"\n",
        "    \"4. Psychological Defense Mechanisms and the Survival of Memeplexes\\n\"\n",
        "    \"Humans employ various psychological defenses that inadvertently protect and perpetuate memeplexes:\\n\"\n",
        "    \"- Reaction Formation: Using 'Allah' in wishes or fears as a subconscious defense, even when doubting its validity.\\n\"\n",
        "    \"- Suppression and Anticipation: Deliberately omitting 'Allah' from speech as a higher-level defense, akin to removing a virus from the body.\\n\"\n",
        "    \"- Humor and Projection: Mocking or externalizing the concept to weaken its hold, reflecting advanced defense strategies.\\n\\n\"\n",
        "    \"5. The Evolution of Conceptual Lifeforms\\n\"\n",
        "    \"Just as biological species evolve, memeplexes transform over time. Even if a concept like 'Allah' is marginalized, \"\n",
        "    \"it may adapt, reemerging as mysticism or scientific metaphor. Total eradication is rare; instead, memeplexes often evolve into less harmful or more abstract forms.\\n\\n\"\n",
        "    \"6. Societal Impacts: From Religion to Capitalism\\n\"\n",
        "    \"The persistence of powerful memeplexes like 'Allah' can have profound effects—both positive and negative—on society. \"\n",
        "    \"In some cases, other memeplexes (e.g., the 'god of money' or capitalism) exploit religious structures to maintain control, \"\n",
        "    \"sometimes exacerbating social problems and hindering progress, especially in regions like the Middle East.\\n\\n\"\n",
        "    \"7. Toward Conceptual Hygiene: Strategies for Change\\n\"\n",
        "    \"To reduce the negative impact of harmful memeplexes, individuals and societies can:\\n\"\n",
        "    \"- Practice conscious language use, minimizing the spread of outdated or harmful concepts.\\n\"\n",
