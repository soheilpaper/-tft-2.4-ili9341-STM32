            "[05:41.040 --> 05:45.840]  Like it's as a first time founder, you experience so many things for the first time, which can\n",

            "[05:46.880 --> 05:51.920]  You know, second time founders, like, you know, one of the things we've been saying\n",

            "[06:08.300 --> 06:11.239]  You know, cracking beers left and right.\n",
            "[06:11.440 --> 06:12.490]  Like what a what a rush.\n",
            "[06:13.560 --> 06:15.599]  And yet, you know, the next day we didn't feel that way.\n",
            "[06:15.861 --> 06:17.594]  It was just more more revenue.\n",
            "[06:18.701 --> 06:24.459]  And so, yeah, if you if you take away all those fun little moments, where do you find\n",
            "[06:24.800 --> 06:27.819]  the motivation to go further and to push harder?\n",
            "[06:27.960 --> 06:28.973]  It's got to come from somewhere else.\n",
            "[06:29.861 --> 06:36.160]  Yeah, that one's also fun because you know, the lows are going to suck, right?\n",
            "[06:36.280 --> 06:37.919]  So it's actually it hits you on both sides.\n",
            "[06:38.040 --> 06:42.039]  Like, you know, that they're going to be moments you hate your life as a second time founder.\n",
            "[06:42.702 --> 06:47.180]  But you also know, like the first amazing hire would just feel like, yeah, that's one\n",
            "[06:47.260 --> 06:50.660]  of the first hundred people I have to hire great and then thousand people, you know,\n",
            "[06:50.720 --> 06:55.398]  it's like none of these moments kind of stick as much anymore in your head.\n",
            "[06:55.960 --> 06:57.110]  And that can be demoralizing.\n",
            "[06:58.280 --> 07:04.100]  I think one of the other tricky advantages first time founders is that like, because\n",
            "[07:04.200 --> 07:09.360]  they're going to have harder times typically raising money or hiring employees, they tend\n",
            "[07:09.380 --> 07:14.080]  to have to innovate more like they tend to have to they're constrained into building\n",
            "[07:14.182 --> 07:14.774]  something good.\n",
            "[07:15.261 --> 07:18.960]  Whereas like the lack of constraints so often lead people astray.\n",
            "[07:19.525 --> 07:20.677]  Yeah, I think that's a common one.\n",
            "[07:20.940 --> 07:23.719]  That's what's the phrase like constraints breed creativity.\n",
            "[07:23.840 --> 07:29.740]  Like, I definitely see that, especially with early stage startups, because, yeah, as a\n",
            "[07:29.840 --> 07:34.040]  second time founder, all of these things play in again, like you can use you have an easier\n",
            "[07:34.101 --> 07:35.040]  time raising funding.\n",
            "[07:35.120 --> 07:38.896]  So you don't need to have the product be necessarily as amazing to raise your first round.\n",
            "[07:39.760 --> 07:43.840]  You often have other people who are willing to try it out and be beta users or testers\n",
            "[07:43.840 --> 07:49.198]  or whatever so it can, you know, your friends and family network is potentially larger.\n",
            "[07:49.800 --> 07:54.220]  Whereas a first time founder, you can get press to write about what you write, what\n",
            "[07:54.240 --> 07:55.016]  you're launching as well.\n",
            "[07:55.567 --> 07:55.709]  Right?\n",
            "[07:56.240 --> 08:00.840]  Whereas a first time founder, the only way you're getting your first few users is having\n",
            "[08:00.921 --> 08:03.179]  a really great product and being really great at selling it.\n",
            "[08:03.240 --> 08:06.378]  I think you just get a little bit lazy on that front as a second time founder.\n",
            "[08:07.046 --> 08:07.229]  Yeah.\n",
            "[08:07.760 --> 08:09.895]  And then the other one is this idea of honesty.\n",
            "[08:10.640 --> 08:16.380]  Like, Brad, you think a second time founder, it's really possible to get honest feedback\n",
            "[08:16.480 --> 08:19.218]  from your investors or friends or things like that?\n",
            "[08:19.520 --> 08:22.039]  Or do people have a hard time being honest with you?\n",
            "[08:22.240 --> 08:23.409]  Yeah, I think it's harder.\n",
            "[08:24.760 --> 08:29.120]  When you're a first time founder, nobody cares about you because they don't have any sort\n",
            "[08:29.161 --> 08:30.499]  of relationship with you yet.\n",
            "[08:30.841 --> 08:35.339]  You know, you talk to some investor and you're just the product and they tell you if they\n",
            "[08:35.721 --> 08:36.669]  want to invest or not.\n",
            "[08:37.840 --> 08:41.280]  And but then after you've been through a process with people and you've built some sort of\n",
            "[08:41.401 --> 08:46.040]  rapport and relationship, it's now costly to tell them what you really think about what\n",
            "[08:46.101 --> 08:46.775]  they're working on.\n",
            "[08:47.381 --> 08:51.679]  You know, it basically it all just comes from it's just a continuation of the same, the\n",
            "[08:51.900 --> 08:55.858]  first startup being carried through into the second one and not having like a clean break\n",
            "[08:56.260 --> 08:57.891]  and resetting all those relationships.\n",
            "[08:59.360 --> 09:05.520]  But yeah, I definitely just it's really hard to get, you know, real true feedback from\n",
            "[09:05.561 --> 09:05.806]  people.\n",
            "[09:06.520 --> 09:10.600]  And it's just part of the broader thing that first time founders often don't get is that\n",
            "[09:10.640 --> 09:15.060]  when you're getting feedback on your idea from investors in particular, like they're\n",
            "[09:15.180 --> 09:20.480]  not their pure motivation is not to just give you the highest quality feedback they possibly\n",
            "[09:20.521 --> 09:20.827]  can.\n",
            "[09:21.560 --> 09:25.718]  Like they're often playing a different game, which is how do they set themselves up to\n",
            "[09:26.241 --> 09:29.217]  get referrals to other good startups in the future?\n",
            "[09:29.820 --> 09:33.739]  And it's like when you're a second time founder, the investors know that you know more people.\n",
            "[09:34.040 --> 09:36.499]  They don't want to give you bad feedback, right?\n",
            "[09:36.600 --> 09:40.540]  Like they're incentivized to tell you nice things so that you'll continue being nice\n",
            "[09:40.642 --> 09:40.887]  to them.\n",
            "[09:41.560 --> 09:46.059]  Whereas when you're a first time founder, you're less useful to an investor in that\n",
            "[09:46.200 --> 09:46.302]  way.\n",
            "[09:47.200 --> 09:51.279]  So they kind of can be a little bit more like just direct with what they think about you.\n",
            "[09:51.600 --> 09:56.040]  They can treat you without the kid gloves or the they don't wrap you up in cotton wool\n",
            "[09:56.101 --> 09:56.428]  as much.\n",
            "[09:57.040 --> 10:00.679]  Yeah, what I've also seen for second time founders is that oftentimes for an investor,\n",
            "[10:00.840 --> 10:01.588]  it's more of a catch.\n",
            "[10:02.640 --> 10:07.959]  It like helps you build your reputation in your firm, or it helps you get the deal approved.\n",
            "[10:08.280 --> 10:12.680]  And like, so oftentimes there's like internal political reasons why you might be getting\n",
            "[10:12.841 --> 10:17.439]  funded that have like nothing to do with your product being great or your users loving you,\n",
            "[10:17.680 --> 10:22.259]  you know, and you're never told that stuff, right?\n",
            "[10:22.480 --> 10:27.760]  Like it's just kind of happening in the background and you don't really know that you're being\n",
            "[10:27.841 --> 10:29.118]  graded on a different front.\n",
            "[10:29.300 --> 10:33.934]  Whereas like you said, when you're a first time founder, you're nobody, nobody cares.\n",
            "[10:36.120 --> 10:39.740]  You find that eventually though, it's a little bit like taking out debt, honestly, where\n",
            "[10:39.840 --> 10:44.779]  it's like maybe early on as a second time founder, like maybe the seed rounds easier,\n",
            "[10:45.140 --> 10:46.432]  maybe even a series A is easier.\n",
            "[10:47.581 --> 10:52.160]  But the later, the longer you're working your startup for, the more people just care about\n",
            "[10:52.260 --> 10:52.852]  the results.\n",
            "[10:53.300 --> 10:57.480]  And like, sooner or later, if you don't have a product, if it doesn't actually have product\n",
            "[10:57.500 --> 11:01.440]  market fit, if you don't have customers who love you and will do a reference call saying\n",
            "[11:01.520 --> 11:04.555]  how great your product is, like the whole thing falls down.\n",
            "[11:05.600 --> 11:08.758]  And so I think that's another thing often we can see with like a first time founder,\n",
            "[11:09.080 --> 11:10.636]  like they never had it easy.\n",
            "[11:11.040 --> 11:16.120]  So they just had to learn how to operate like at a certain like level of execution from\n",
            "[11:16.202 --> 11:16.732]  day one.\n",
            "[11:17.120 --> 11:21.160]  Whereas a second time founder, you sometimes it's a little bit like you're like driving\n",
            "[11:21.281 --> 11:22.757]  on like autopilot or something.\n",
            "[11:23.080 --> 11:27.499]  And then it like the autopilot gets shut off and now you're like, oh crap, like I have\n",
            "[11:27.820 --> 11:31.060]  to actually figure out like how to get like a great product shipped.\n",
            "[11:31.180 --> 11:34.840]  I have to like actually fix all these problems because now I'm not gonna be able to raise\n",
            "[11:34.940 --> 11:39.600]  investment or get to like the next revenue milestone unless I have something that's really\n",
            "[11:39.661 --> 11:39.947]  good.\n",
            "[11:40.600 --> 11:40.865]  It's funny.\n",
            "[11:41.600 --> 11:44.437]  I love that analogy because in that analogy, when the autopilot gets shut off, you're like\n",
            "[11:45.000 --> 11:49.159]  going 120 miles an hour down like a curvy mountain road.\n",
            "[11:49.360 --> 11:49.544]  Right.\n",
            "[11:50.762 --> 11:53.800]  Well, I thought everything was good, the computer was driving.\n",
            "[11:53.880 --> 12:03.760]  Whereas at least the first time start, you start on like some suburban road going two\n",
            "[12:03.963 --> 12:04.616]  miles an hour.\n",
            "[12:05.086 --> 12:05.310]  Oh man.\n",
            "[12:06.473 --> 12:06.780]  All right.\n",
            "[12:07.123 --> 12:08.898]  Well, let's be clear, though.\n",
            "[12:09.120 --> 12:14.240]  Like someone should play devil's advocate because certainly there are some advantages\n",
            "[12:14.341 --> 12:15.828]  to being a second time founder.\n",
            "[12:18.160 --> 12:23.760]  What do y'all think is like the first kind of big boy here on the massive advantage being\n",
            "[12:23.842 --> 12:24.515]  a second time founder?\n",
            "[12:24.780 --> 12:31.340]  Well, I think if you did your first startup and got some semblance of financial independence\n",
            "[12:31.480 --> 12:39.099]  from it, then you don't carry the same like massive weight of asking yourself constantly,\n",
            "[12:39.360 --> 12:46.120]  how the heck am I going to survive, eat, sleep, whatever that first time founders often carry\n",
            "[12:46.202 --> 12:46.487]  with them.\n",
            "[12:47.120 --> 12:47.263]  Right.\n",
            "[12:48.140 --> 12:51.660]  And I think for a lot of first time founders, we know lots of first time founders, that\n",
            "[12:51.841 --> 12:57.118]  desperation in their eyes, which is a great thing sometimes it helps drive them forward,\n",
            "[12:57.640 --> 13:00.539]  also comes with a cost of just being stressed out all the time.\n",
            "[13:00.760 --> 13:05.600]  And it can lead to some short term thinking in terms of what to work on, how to sell your\n",
            "[13:05.681 --> 13:08.258]  product, what go to market strategy.\n",
            "[13:08.620 --> 13:12.920]  I see a lot of companies that just want to do product led growth, for example, because\n",
            "[13:13.000 --> 13:17.019]  they think that'll get them their first revenue when really they should be selling enterprise,\n",
            "[13:17.160 --> 13:20.372]  which might take a while, but actually be the fit for their business, for example.\n",
            "[13:22.320 --> 13:26.360]  Whereas if you have some financial independence, like a lot of second time founders, you can\n",
            "[13:26.461 --> 13:30.020]  think bigger and actually like play out the implications of the business that you're going\n",
            "[13:30.181 --> 13:33.398]  after and try to build something that's optimized to get big from day one.\n",
            "[13:34.127 --> 13:34.270]  Yeah.\n",
            "[13:34.760 --> 13:38.120]  You know, and that's a big one when you want to have family or want to own a house, just\n",
            "[13:38.180 --> 13:43.479]  like, you know, being able to not if you're successful, as you mentioned, being of using\n",
            "[13:43.860 --> 13:48.999]  that money to free your life of distractions can be a big advantage.\n",
            "[13:49.240 --> 13:53.840]  You know, you can up the childcare, you can up the quality of the home, the quality of\n",
            "[13:53.840 --> 13:55.778]  the space you live in, and so on and so forth.\n",
            "[13:56.262 --> 13:58.656]  Like for sure, that's one.\n",
            "[13:59.280 --> 14:00.279]  What do you think, Harjit?\n",
            "[14:00.320 --> 14:03.416]  Another devil's advocate position here on why second time founders have an advantage?\n",
            "[14:04.120 --> 14:08.899]  Another very specific type of startup that seems to be suited to second time founders\n",
            "[14:09.422 --> 14:11.137]  are capital intensive businesses.\n",
            "[14:12.282 --> 14:19.160]  And by that, I mean, you know, any startup where like more money raised or just more\n",
            "[14:19.301 --> 14:24.640]  money is a strategic advantage, second time founders who are good at raising money can\n",
            "[14:24.722 --> 14:25.273]  benefit, right?\n",
            "[14:25.640 --> 14:27.218]  So let's make some examples around it.\n",
            "[14:27.742 --> 14:30.819]  Like there's famous ones like Elon Musk, probably the most famous one, right?\n",
            "[14:31.000 --> 14:35.878]  Like he started, I think it was Zip2 or something, then PayPal, but now SpaceX and Tesla.\n",
            "[14:36.440 --> 14:38.939]  But from our own orbit, like we have examples.\n",
            "[14:39.221 --> 14:43.040]  I speak of a personal one, a friend and former roommate of mine, Eric Wu, the YC founder\n",
            "[14:43.121 --> 14:44.358]  who started a company called Moviety.\n",
            "[14:44.540 --> 14:49.139]  It was acquired by Trulia pretty early on, but like it was a good exit for him.\n",
            "[14:49.461 --> 14:50.400]  And then he started Opendoor, right?\n",
            "[14:50.823 --> 14:53.179]  Opendoor is now a public company worth billions of dollars.\n",
            "[14:53.320 --> 14:56.980]  And I think Opendoor is a company, he's raised like well over a billion dollars for that\n",
            "[14:57.061 --> 14:57.367]  company.\n",
            "[14:58.181 --> 15:01.417]  And I think that was much easier for him to do as a second time founder.\n",
            "[15:02.100 --> 15:05.499]  Well, but people probably won't know, why is Opendoor so capital intensive?\n",
            "[15:05.781 --> 15:07.838]  Oh, because they're actually buying and selling houses.\n",
            "[15:08.160 --> 15:09.867]  So like, yeah, it can be more intensive.\n",

            "[15:19.501 --> 15:20.808]  Definitely helps to have a lot of money.\n",
            "[15:23.120 --> 15:24.538]  Good software, not sufficient.\n",
            "[15:25.870 --> 15:26.839]  Software plus money.\n",
            "[15:27.225 --> 15:27.552]  Yeah.\n",
            "[15:28.021 --> 15:28.246]  Oh, man.\n",
            "[15:29.040 --> 15:32.920]  Another classic example is Blake from Boom, who started a software company and sold it\n",
            "[15:33.000 --> 15:36.079]  and then decided to make a supersonic jet company, right?\n",
            "[15:37.323 --> 15:43.118]  And another example of a company that like will take a decade to make the first flight\n",
            "[15:44.140 --> 15:49.017]  and at least, and that's like on an aggressive timeframe, that would be a massive accomplishment.\n",
            "[15:50.081 --> 15:55.260]  And so, yeah, being able to say I've already exited, I've already given my investors cash\n",
            "[15:55.360 --> 15:58.977]  back, like that's really helpful when you have to build a supersonic jet company.\n",
            "[15:59.560 --> 16:00.409]  Any other examples here, Brad?\n",
            "[16:01.781 --> 16:08.780]  I mean, I think you can look at Cruise, for example, and you can look at like what Max\n",
            "[16:08.880 --> 16:12.800]  has done, Max Levchin with all the different companies that he's built, and each one just\n",
            "[16:12.840 --> 16:15.352]  gets more and more and more and more ambitious.\n",
            "[16:16.980 --> 16:19.736]  And it's just something you can do more as a second time founder.\n",
            "[16:20.521 --> 16:25.919]  I think what I will say though, is that so many founders are confused about whether they're\n",
            "[16:26.140 --> 16:28.619]  building a business where money is the real advantage.\n",
            "[16:28.800 --> 16:32.099]  Like I would certainly say that's the minority of businesses here.\n",
            "[16:32.822 --> 16:36.720]  When we describe what's going on, we have like large physical, like our examples are\n",
            "[16:36.861 --> 16:38.093]  large physical things, right?\n",
            "[16:38.780 --> 16:44.900]  Rockets, cars, self-driving cars, and hypersonic planes, right?\n",
            "[16:45.121 --> 16:47.516]  So large physical things clearly need a lot of money.\n",
            "[16:48.180 --> 16:49.180]  Also lending, right?\n",
            "[16:49.180 --> 16:52.977]  You know, Brex, second time founders, they extend credit to startups.\n",
            "[16:53.640 --> 16:55.475]  Max Levchin with the firm extending credit.\n",
            "[16:56.020 --> 17:00.036]  So it's like lending and big physical things definitely require a lot of money.\n",
            "[17:00.920 --> 17:04.480]  It's not obvious to me that there are many other business categories that require a lot\n",
            "[17:04.541 --> 17:05.878]  of money where cash is the advantage.\n",
            "[17:06.100 --> 17:10.399]  So if you're doing one of those two, it might make sense.\n",
            "[17:10.843 --> 17:11.027]  Yeah.\n",
            "[17:11.680 --> 17:14.640]  And if you're one of the many people listening at home who's thinking about building a software\n",

            "[17:18.580 --> 17:20.477]  Having all this access to capital is not going to do it.\n",
            "[17:20.760 --> 17:21.954]  You go out and talk to your users.\n",
            "[17:22.480 --> 17:23.572]  That's what's going to make the difference.\n",
            "[17:24.240 --> 17:25.579]  In fact, it'll hurt them, right?\n",
            "[17:25.680 --> 17:28.600]  Because they'll spend it on, instead of spending it on, you know, rockets and stuff, they'll\n",
            "[17:28.661 --> 17:29.938]  spend it on too many employees.\n",
            "[17:30.201 --> 17:32.000]  And then, yeah, we'll see.\n",
            "[17:32.040 --> 17:33.132]  We all know that when it was going to happen then.\n",
            "[17:33.800 --> 17:38.478]  So maybe the last area is when you're building in a space, you know, really well.\n",
            "[17:39.120 --> 17:41.439]  You know, Har, do you know Parker Conrad well?\n",
            "[17:41.600 --> 17:43.640]  Like you've seen him build two companies in the same space.\n",
            "[17:43.681 --> 17:44.456]  What are your thoughts on this?\n",
            "[17:44.660 --> 17:44.905]  Yeah.\n",
            "[17:45.640 --> 17:46.395]  Parker is a great example, right?\n",
            "[17:46.640 --> 17:49.539]  Like you built Zenefits, which was worth like $4 billion at its peak.\n",
            "[17:49.861 --> 17:52.737]  And then like he started Rippling, which is now worth like over $10 billion.\n",
            "[17:53.240 --> 17:58.398]  And I think if you sort of ask him to sort of explain that a little bit, he'll say that\n",
            "[17:59.040 --> 18:04.240]  the experience of working on Zenefits gave him really deep domain expertise around how\n",
            "[18:04.481 --> 18:07.257]  to build like high quality HR software and sell it.\n",
            "[18:07.820 --> 18:11.240]  And he used all that expertise to build something even bigger with Rippling, right?\n",
            "[18:11.300 --> 18:17.578]  Like he's clearly a world class domain expert in how to build effective HR software.\n",
            "[18:18.280 --> 18:19.399]  And you know, I've looked it up.\n",
            "[18:19.480 --> 18:21.040]  The Workday founders, very similar.\n",
            "[18:21.141 --> 18:24.459]  You know, one of the Workday founders was a CEO of PeopleSoft.\n",
            "[18:24.720 --> 18:29.540]  And then he saw how the world was moving to the cloud and he decided to move along with\n",
            "[18:29.600 --> 18:29.661]  it.\n",
            "[18:30.600 --> 18:34.156]  So there's definitely advantage if you've got like intense, deep knowledge about a space.\n",
            "[18:35.160 --> 18:39.339]  And by the way, and you're not sick of that space and you want to go back to it for another\n",
            "[18:39.701 --> 18:40.370]  couple decades.\n",
            "[18:41.080 --> 18:46.540]  But Michael, that raises the other point I want to make about this, which is that it's\n",
            "[18:46.721 --> 18:52.320]  so common to talk to a second time founder and they just hate the market they were just\n",
            "[18:52.402 --> 18:52.851]  working in.\n",
            "[18:53.522 --> 18:55.499]  And then, oh, like, oh, never do that.\n",
            "[18:55.862 --> 18:57.453]  One of those startups, it's the worst.\n",
            "[18:58.400 --> 19:00.695]  Whatever the market is, if they did a startup in it, it's terrible.\n",
            "[19:01.480 --> 19:06.800]  And yet we're highlighting that when they go back, that's one of the times when it can\n",
            "[19:06.901 --> 19:07.548]  be really good.\n",
            "[19:08.600 --> 19:12.120]  Another really important point about that, though, Brad, is that it's why it's really\n",
            "[19:12.281 --> 19:17.680]  important if you're a first time founder and you get feedback on your idea from a founder\n",
            "[19:17.840 --> 19:21.560]  who had tried the idea before and failed, is you have to be very careful.\n",
            "[19:21.620 --> 19:25.038]  Because on the one hand, there's probably interesting learning for you there.\n",
            "[19:25.440 --> 19:29.720]  But the other hand, you have to remember that sometimes when founders don't succeed in a\n",
            "[19:29.860 --> 19:34.159]  market, they end up hating that market and they kind of don't want anyone to succeed\n",
            "[19:34.280 --> 19:37.817]  because otherwise it's sort of like, it's sort of like hurts their own self image.\n",
            "[19:38.721 --> 19:40.393]  And so this is something I noticed.\n",
            "[19:41.440 --> 19:45.540]  I often tell YC founders to talk to other YC founders that have worked on similar things\n",
            "[19:45.641 --> 19:47.054]  before and maybe they've moved on.\n",
            "[19:47.720 --> 19:53.720]  But the trick is to listen to just the facts of what they did and what happened, not what\n",
            "[19:53.780 --> 19:59.120]  they think about it, because we're all so deluded about why things happened or what\n",
            "[19:59.180 --> 20:04.400]  they mean or the significance of them, that it's just not useful signal to founders that\n",
            "[20:04.461 --> 20:05.550]  are building a new business.\n",
            "[20:06.640 --> 20:12.480]  So if we're going to wrap this up, for the person who is thinking about being a first\n",
            "[20:12.500 --> 20:17.200]  time founder, but is worried that they don't have the advantages, what's the kind of parting\n",
            "[20:17.281 --> 20:18.089]  message you want to give them?\n",
            "[20:19.160 --> 20:26.760]  You're actually well situated to build a unique novel business that delivers real value to\n",
            "[20:26.841 --> 20:27.388]  your users.\n",
            "[20:28.360 --> 20:33.497]  And a lot of the glamour that comes with being a repeat founder is a trap.\n",
            "[20:34.520 --> 20:38.220]  And they have their own problems that they're working through and it's not going to help\n",
            "[20:38.240 --> 20:38.383]  them.\n",
            "[20:39.301 --> 20:40.514]  So don't be discouraged by that.\n",
            "[20:41.120 --> 20:43.919]  Understand that you can and should take your swing.\n",
            "[20:44.441 --> 20:48.818]  Yeah, I'd say to first time founders, just don't get sucked into grass is greener syndrome.\n",
            "[20:49.240 --> 20:53.819]  Don't think that just because you've got a competitor that started by a founder who's\n",
            "[20:54.140 --> 20:57.694]  on their second or third company that they're going to crush you.\n",
            "[20:59.080 --> 21:03.120]  As we speak from our own personal perspectives here, often those same second, third time\n",
            "[21:03.180 --> 21:06.856]  founders are wishing that they had the benefits and advantages of the first time founder.\n",
            "[21:07.840 --> 21:14.197]  And I think we would be remiss without adding that some of the biggest companies ever, Google,\n",
            "[21:15.160 --> 21:18.659]  Facebook, Microsoft, first time founders.\n",
            "[21:19.303 --> 21:22.439]  So you're in good company as a first time founder.\n",
            "[21:22.720 --> 21:23.265]  Always remember that.\n",
            "[21:25.020 --> 21:27.518]  Your company is maybe the best founders who ever existed.\n",
